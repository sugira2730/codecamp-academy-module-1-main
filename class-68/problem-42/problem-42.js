DESKTOP TEST (STEP-BY-STEP SIMULATION)
ATM WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM
========================================

Initial State
-------------
balance = 500
continueTransaction = undefined


ITERATION 1
-----------
alert → "Current balance: $500"

User input (prompt):
withdrawal = 200

Condition check:
200 > 500 → false
200 <= 0 → false
isNaN(200) → false

Valid withdrawal

balance = 500 - 200
balance = 300

alert →
"Withdrawal successful.
Remaining balance: $300"

balance === 0 ?
300 === 0 → false

prompt →
"Do you want to make another withdrawal?"

User enters:
continueTransaction = "yes"

Loop condition:
continueTransaction.toLowerCase() === "yes"
"yes" === "yes" → true



ITERATION 2
-----------
alert → "Current balance: $300"

User input:
withdrawal = 300

Condition check:
300 > 300 → false
300 <= 0 → false
isNaN(300) → false

Valid withdrawal

balance = 300 - 300
balance = 0

alert →
"Withdrawal successful.
Remaining balance: $0"

balance === 0 ?
0 === 0 → true

alert →
"Your balance is now $0. No more withdrawals are possible."

break → exit loop

PROGRAM END
